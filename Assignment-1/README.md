This Assignment enables the understanding and examination of running times of different algorithms used in 
order to solve the same problem. 

The problem was a fibonacci sequence and three different algorithms were utilised and their complexities were studied by graphing 
out the time taken for solution vs input size

Language and Technologies used: 
- Python
- Graphing using Matplotlib
